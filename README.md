# print_dashboard

A plugin for Octoprint to display some valuable information and statistics about your prints and printer. Use these displays and predictions created from your print data to determine whether a given print is likely to successful before printing, so you can make adjustments to your nozzle height, temperature, and bed level before wasting money and time on partially completed prints.

**NOTE:** This plugin is still a work in progress! Feel free to take a look around.
